#### Prerequisites

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Clone this repository with _git clone command here_
- Navigate to the directory with the cloned code
- Install Harhdat with `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
- Install all required dependencies with `npm install`
- Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project with the same contents as `.env.example`
- _examples of .env values here_

  :warning:**DO NOT SHARE YOUR .env FILE IN ANY WAY OR YOU RISK TO LOSE ALL YOUR FUNDS**:warning:

### Test

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests can be executed on the hardhat node locally

- Run tests

```
npx hardhat test --network hardhat
```

<a name="run"/>

### Run

```
npx hardhat run *script file name here* --network *network name here*
```

#### Networks

Ð°) **test** network  
Make sure you have _enough test tokens_ for testnet.

```
npx hardhat run *script name here* --network *network name here*
```

a) **main** network  
Make sure you have _enough real tokens_ in your wallet. Deployment to the mainnet costs money!

```
npx hardhat run *script name here* --network *network name here*
```

### Wallets

For deployment you will need to use either _your existing wallet_ or _a generated one_.

#### Using an existing wallet

If you choose to use your existing wallet, then you will need to be able to export (copy/paste) its private key. For example, you can export private key from your MetaMask wallet.  
Wallet's address and private key should be pasted into the `.env` file (see [Prerequisites](#preqs)).

#### Creating a new wallet

If you choose to create a fresh wallet for this project, you should use `createWallet` script from `scripts/` directory.

```
node scripts/createWallet.js
```

This will generate a single new wallet and show its address and private key. **Save** them somewhere else!  
A new wallet _does not_ hold any tokens. You have to provide it with tokens of your choice.  
Wallet's address and private key should be pasted into the `.env` file (see [Prerequisites](#preqs)).
